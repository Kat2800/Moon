# STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT 
## No release and ISO or IMG file will be made before version 1.0. Using the code now may have bugs or incomplete pieces. 💿❌ If you want to install it without a iso file, go to "Setup and installation" section.

# About
Mojito is swiss army knife for ethical hacking (educational purposes only) and penetration testing, it runs on a raspberry pi 0 w/wh that use a wavseshare 1.44 inch lcd HAT display. It has a collection of hacking tools and it is based on Kali Linux. 
This project is called "Mojito" beacuse while the developers were coding this project, they were drinking Mojitos (maked by @rickyfili10)
<br>

# REQUIREMENTS 📃
  - Wavseshare 1.44 inch lcd HAT display 
  - Raspberry pi 0 w/wh 
  - 16 GB sd card (You need much less, but you might need 16 GB for additional packages)
  - An external usb antenna that support packet injection and monitor mode. We recommend RTL8812BU or RTL8822BU Chipsets
  - An USB to Micro USB adapter
<br>

# SETUP AND INSTALLATION

## First version is not been released yet! 
1. <a href="https://etcher.balena.io">Flash</a> and setup <a href="https://kali.download/arm-images/kali-2024.4/kali-linux-2024.4-raspberry-pi-zero-w-armel.img.xz">Kali Linux</a> for raspberry pi 0 wh  <br>
    <br>
2. Create a "wpa_supplicant.conf" file with your wifi informations in the boot partition and create a file called "ssh" with nothing inside. (always in the boot partition of the sd card) <br>
    Don't know how to write a wpa_supplican file? No problem! [Wpa supplicant file example](https://github.com/asparatu/raspberrypi-wpa-supplicant.conf/blob/master/wpa_supplicant.conf)<br>
    <br>
3. Connect to USB port, and if you have it connect the antenna on the OTG port, Then wait... (The first boot is slow, don't worry it's normal!). Then, connect to it using ssh, for example:
```
ssh kali@192.168.1.214
```
You can see Mojito ip from your WiFi Router.
If it doesn't seem to appear, try connecting it to an HDMI and plugging a keyboard into it to try connecting to the wifi manually.<br>
# Now you can setup with Mojito Setup Helper! 
## Moggy will be happy to help you during the setup! 😸
### Clone the Mojito Repostory and enter in it
```
 git clone https://github.com/rickyfili10/Mojito.git && cd Mojito/src
```
### Run Mojito Setup Helper! 🔧
```
sudo python msh.py
```
### Follow and fill out his requests!
## Remember: This is not the first version of Mojito! You're using the "uncomplete" code of Mojito, it might not work and many function could not work as well
# SIMBOLS LIST: 
   - NB! = No Battery Found! <br> 
   - Plug = pluged to a power source 🔌<br>
   - N% = battery level ( not tested ) 🔋<br>
